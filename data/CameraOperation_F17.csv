Was never raised or fixed in Fall. This camera seems to be in completely different position compared to summer 2017. For Fall, camera was moved significant to the right. Any seasonal comparisons, or pooling of detection distance measurements needs to be assessed closely. After fall the camera was never raised again, until February 2nd, part of the way through winter."

Changed range and orientation of camera but still functioned well. Looks like no one noticed the change, so this may have continued through Winter. Winter was in the shifted position, and while OK independently, cannot be compared with Summer and this first half of Fall. Card filled Nov 30 641AM. Do we need to make a line for 0305_F17-2 so that we can use the rest of these sequences after 10/16/2017  in the fall analysis, but exclude it when we compare it to the winter and summer?"

Started deployment then. The camera was somehow moved again on Oct 16 between 1258 am and 842 am. Not sure how. But angle changed dramatically. On Nov 6 at 1513 it changed again by staff, back to original angle. I think I need to just ignore it.  Large log in view obscures much of lower level, camera likely has short detection distance. Need to compare fall view with summer view to see if significantly different. 12/1 12:02 pic with both squirrel species."

We had this same problem in the summer but we are still using the whole deployment. This is the camera that had dew on the inside of the lense, which was noted in the camera check on 04/05/2018. Last sequence in on 11/28 due to SD card filled. Sems like deer and raccoons feeding on acorns in front of camera most of the time?"
